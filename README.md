# XServer For Unity3D
Original: https://github.com/thedxe/XServer

This is a fork of XServer, tweaked and improved in order to embed within a Unity3D application. The code has only really been tested on a Windows desktop application with Unity Pro so there are likely to be issues with other platforms. Contributions welcome :)
