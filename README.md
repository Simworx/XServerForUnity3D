# XServer For Unity3D

This is a fork of XServer, tweaked and improved in order to embed within a Unity3D application. The code has only really been tested on a Windows desktop application with Unity Pro so there are likely to be issues with other platforms. Contributions welcome :)

If you encounter issues with importing types from the XServer (TypeLoadException), ensure Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Api Compatibility Level is set to ".NET 2.0" (not the subset).
